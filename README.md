# DeepFake Image Classifier

Welcome to the DeepFake Image Classifier project! This project utilizes a Deep Learning model based on the Inception V3 architecture, pre-trained on a large dataset of both fake and real images. The model is capable of classifying images into two categories: fake and real.

## Overview

With the rise of DeepFake technology, distinguishing between real and manipulated images has become increasingly challenging. This project aims to address this issue by leveraging state-of-the-art Deep Learning techniques to accurately classify images.

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** Programming language used for model development and backend implementation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning framework used for building and training the Inception V3 model.
- **Streamlit:** Web application framework used for building the user interface.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Frontend technologies used for designing and interacting with the Streamlit app.
- **Docker:** Containerization tool used for packaging the application.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahaji-2003/Deepfake-image-classifier.git
